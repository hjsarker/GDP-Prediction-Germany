# GDP Growth Prediction for Germany

üìä Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting Germany's GDP growth for the year 2025 using machine learning techniques. The process involves data collection, preprocessing, model training, and final prediction.

üîç Data Collection and Preprocessing

The data was collected from various reliable financial and economic sources (Mostly from the World Bank API), ensuring comprehensive coverage of Germany's economic indicators. After collection, the data was manually reviewed to correct any inconsistencies, and missing values were filled using verified external data sources. This preprocessing step ensures data quality and accuracy for the predictive model.

ü§ñ Model Development

The model was built using the XGBoost Regressor, a robust and efficient machine-learning algorithm for regression tasks. Initially, the data was split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance. After validating the model with promising results, the final model was trained on the entire dataset to enhance its predictive power.
